## Overview

Starting with episode 2 of The .NET Show, I am building a mobile podcast app for my podcast, .NET Rocks! using Xamarin Forms. 

At this point our app has a home page that shows episodes. When the user taps the "Details" button, we show a detail page with sophisticated media control: Play, Pause, Stop, Go Back, and Go Forward.

In this episode we are going to add Playlist functionality. Here are the user stories:

- As a user, I want to create a new playlist, and give it a name.
- As a user, I want the app to automatically persist my playlists.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a playlist from the list of playlists I have created.
- As a user, I want to delete an existing playlist.
- As a user, I want to select one or more episodes to add to a playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove episodes from my playlist.
- As a user, I want to be able to move episodes in my playlist forward or backward in play order.
- As a user, I want the same level of audio control for a playlist as I have for a single episode: Play, Pause, Stop, Go Back, and Go Forward.
